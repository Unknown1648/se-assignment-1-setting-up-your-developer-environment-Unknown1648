Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   Step-by-step instructions on how to download and install Windows:

Preparation:
Check System Requirements:**
   Before downloading Windows, ensure your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the version of Windows you want to install. Microsoft provides detailed system requirements on their website.

**Backup Your Data:**
   It's crucial to back up any important data on your computer before proceeding with the installation. While the installation process typically preserves your files, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Downloading Windows:
**Visit Microsoft's Website:**
   Go to the official Microsoft website (https://www.microsoft.com) and navigate to the Windows section.
**Choose the Windows Version:**
   Select the version of Windows you want to download. You'll typically have options like Windows 10 or Windows 11, depending on what's currently available.
**Download Tool:**
   Microsoft offers a tool called the "Media Creation Tool" that helps you create installation media (USB or DVD) or directly upgrade your current PC. Download this tool from the official Microsoft website.
**Run the Media Creation Tool:**
   Once downloaded, run the Media Creation Tool. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the edition of Windows you want to install and create installation media (USB flash drive or ISO file).

### Installing Windows:
**Prepare Installation Media:**
   If you created a USB installation media, insert it into your computer. If you downloaded an ISO file, you'll need to burn it to a DVD or create a bootable USB drive using a tool like Rufus (https://rufus.ie).
**Start the Installation:**
   Insert the installation media into your computer and restart it. Make sure your BIOS or UEFI settings are configured to boot from the installation media.
**Follow On-Screen Instructions:**
   Windows Setup should start. Follow the on-screen instructions to select language, time, and keyboard preferences.
**Enter Product Key:**
    You may be prompted to enter a product key. Enter the key if you have one, or choose to skip this step (you can activate Windows later).
**Choose Installation Type:**
    Select "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" to perform a clean installation, which is recommended if you're installing Windows on a new hard drive or SSD.
**Partition and Format Drives:**
    If required, partition and format your hard drive or SSD where you want to install Windows. Follow the prompts to complete this process.
**Install Windows:**
    Select the partition where you want to install Windows and click "Next". Windows will begin installing. This process may take some time depending on your computer's speed.
**Complete Setup:**
    Once the installation is complete, follow the remaining on-screen prompts to personalize your Windows settings, such as creating a user account and selecting your preferences.
**Install Drivers and Updates:**
    After Windows is installed, it's essential to install drivers for your hardware (like graphics cards, sound cards, etc.) and run Windows Update to ensure your system is up to date with the latest security patches and drivers.

Final Steps:
**Restore Backups:**
    If you backed up your data, you can now restore it to your newly installed Windows system.
**Activate Windows:**
    If you skipped entering a product key during installation, you'll need to activate Windows. Go to Settings > Update & Security > Activation and follow the prompts to enter your product key or purchase one.

3. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

   Visit the Official Website:
Go to the official Visual Studio Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

Download for Your Operating System:
The website should automatically detect your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and display the corresponding download link. If not, manually select your operating system from the options provided.

Click on the Download Button:
Click on the download button to start downloading the installer package for Visual Studio Code.

Installing Visual Studio Code:
For Windows:
Run the Installer:
Once the download is complete, locate the installer file (usually named something like VSCodeSetup-{version}.exe) in your Downloads folder or the location where you saved it.

Launch the Installer:
Double-click the installer file to launch the installation wizard.

Follow the Setup Wizard:
Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup wizard. Typically, you'll need to:

Accept the license agreement.
Choose the destination folder where you want to install VS Code (the default location is usually fine).
Optionally, choose additional tasks like adding VS Code to the PATH or creating desktop shortcuts.
Install Visual Studio Code:
Click on the "Install" button to begin the installation process. This may take a few moments to complete.

Launch Visual Studio Code:
Once the installation is finished, you can launch Visual Studio Code by clicking on the "Finish" button or by finding it in your Start Menu or desktop shortcut.
Setting Up Visual Studio Code:
Extensions and Customization:
Upon launching Visual Studio Code for the first time, you can install extensions to enhance its functionality. You can browse and install extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X).

Configure Settings:
Customize your settings by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left corner and selecting "Settings". Here you can adjust various preferences and configurations to suit your workflow.

Start Coding:
Visual Studio Code is now ready for use! You can open a folder or file and start writing code.


5. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

6. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

7. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

8. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

9. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

10. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

11. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.
